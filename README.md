# Python-Data-Structures

This repository defines the basics of Python Data Structures. 
It has almost all the main functions that a particular data structure can support with the details about them.

#Note: 
Most of the working is done using functions and all the function calls are commented. 
You have to uncomment the function call to check the working of particular function.
